so basically the idea

game name: the gorge
namespace: tg_
the game starts, some story <tbd> scrolls across the screen. then huh fade from black to game. your inside a ravine/gorge, let the player explore but have a bones corpse near by with a laser gun mounted to the side, and some rations or some stuff. no way for the player to escape at this time. 

have a cave or some jazz that they can wander into, inside of which find an old military style underground base. include random stuff, have some old crts (maybe digiterms like screens) with content the player can interact with to learn some hints

in the back, find an old humoid like robot, require the player to use some material from the complex to start the robot up. some dialog, then the robot can be the players companion and useful for something

<player getting out of the gorge gameplay tbh> - however the robot is a hard requirement for getting out

once out, the game conclude with a fade to black, message, etc. dunno whats at the top, but maybe wall=e like vibes (destroyed world)
this allows for after game jam type season 2/follow up content eventually
